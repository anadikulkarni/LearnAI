Consider renaming it to something that indicates what this function does, or its purpose.\\n2. **Add a docstring**: A docstring (a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a function) provides context about what the function does, its inputs, and outputs. This makes the code more understandable for others (and yourself!) who may need to maintain or use it later.\\n3. **Consider adding a type hint**: Although Python 2.x doesn't support type hints, they're supported since Python 3.5. Adding a type hint can make your function clearer in terms of input types.\\n\\nHere's an improved version:\\n```python\\ndef calculate_meaningful_result() -> None:  # Added a docstring and a type hint\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    This is a placeholder function.\\n    \\n    No actual computation occurs here.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    pass\\n```\\nThese changes make the code more readable, maintainable, and understandable according to industry standards.\"}\n",
